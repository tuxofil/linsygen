              Linux system generator script.

SUMMARY

Produces raw disk image, ready for use in fully virtualisation
systems like QEMU.

This script is adapted for CentOS environment and creates
CentOS system based on repos and package list specified in
configuration file.

REQUIREMENTS

Generator script operates with block devices and operating systems so
it must be started with superuser privileges.

You need following tools installed to run generator:
- yum;
- chroot;
- losetup;
- parted;
- kpartx;
- fdisk;
- ssh-keygen;
- tar;
- mkfs.ext3.

Also you need to load following kernel modules:
- loop - to use arbitrary files as block devices;
- dm_mod (device mapper) - to map disk image partitions to separate block devices.

CONFIGURATION

See comments in *.conf files for details.

RUNNING GENERATION

Invocate to './generate.sh ./<config>' from current directory. It will exit
with 0 exit code on success and 'tmp/image.raw' file as result of generation.
Also you will find '.ssh/id_rsa' SSH identity file which can be used for
passwordless access to running VMs started with disk image generated.

RUNNING TARGET SYSTEM

You can run target system with command like this:

$ qemu -m 128M -hda tmp/image.raw -net nic,vlan=0,model=virtio -net tap,vlan=0,ifname=tap0,script=no

CUSTOMISATION

This script uses only widespread system utilities which exists in
most of Linux distributions. Due to this you can easily
adapt './generate.sh' script for use in your custom environment.
The one requirement is for package manager - it must support
chrooted installation.
