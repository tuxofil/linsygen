              Linux system generator script.

SUMMARY

Produces raw disk image, ready for use in fully virtualization
systems like QEMU.

The script is adapted for Ubuntu environment and creates
Linux system based on packages listed in 'PACKAGES' variable of
a config file from mirror referenced by 'MIRROR' variable of
the config file.

See comments in an example configuration file utopic.conf
Rest of target system configuration you must apply by yourself by
scripting.

Tested for Utopic.

REQUIREMENTS

The generator script operates with block devices and other
OS level stuff so it must be started with superuser privileges.

The generator requires following tools installed:
- debootstrap;
- chroot;
- losetup;
- parted;
- kpartx;
- fdisk;
- ssh-keygen;
- tar;
- mkfs.ext3.

Ensure the following kernel modules are loaded before you generate:
- loop - to use arbitrary files as block devices;
- dm_mod (device mapper) - to map disk image partitions to separate block devices.

RUNNING GENERATION

Invoke the './generate.sh' from current directory. It will exit
with 0 exit code on success and 'tmp/image.raw' file as a result of generation.
Also you will find a '.ssh/id_rsa' SSH identity file which can be used for
passwordless access to running VMs started with disk image generated.

RUNNING TARGET SYSTEM

You can run target system with command like this:

$ qemu -m 128M -hda tmp/image.raw -net nic,vlan=0,model=virtio -net tap,vlan=0,ifname=tap0,script=no
